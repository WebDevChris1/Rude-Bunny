# Rude-Bunny

I chose this project for several reasons mainly because it was a bunch of new material and tricks to learn. I have learned the usefulness in using variables to quickly alter certain elements "on the fly". This project also gave me the oppertunity to use and learn more about before and after pseudo elements.

This project is a clone from another project I saw on codepen.
